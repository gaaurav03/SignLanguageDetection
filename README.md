**Sign-Language-To-Text-and-Speech-Conversion**

**Objective:**
To create a computer software and train a model using CNN which takes an image of hand gesture of American Sign Language and shows the output of the particular sign language in text format converts it into audio format. 


**Scope:**
This System will be Beneficial for Both Dumb/Deaf People and the People Who do not understands the Sign Language. They just need to do that with sign Language gestures and this system will identify what he/she is trying to say after identification it gives the output in the form of Text as well as Speech format. 

**Text To Speech Translation:**

The model translates known gestures into words. we have used pyttsx3 library to convert the recognized words into the appropriate speech. The text-to-speech output is a simple workaround, but it's a useful feature because it simulates a real-life dialogue. 


**Software Requirement:**

Operating System: Windows 8 and Above 

IDE: PyCharm 

Programming Language: Python 3.9 5 

Python libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Keras,mediapipe,Tensorflow
